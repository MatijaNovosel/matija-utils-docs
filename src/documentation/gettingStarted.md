# Getting started

Install `matija-utils` with your package manager of choice:

```bash
npm i matija-utils
yarn add matija-utils
```

Import the functions you need:

```typescript
import { range } from "matija-utils";

for (const n of range(0, 5)) {
  console.log(n);
}
```

And that's all there is to it!
